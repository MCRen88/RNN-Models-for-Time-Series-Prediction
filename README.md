# Attention-Based-RNN-for-Time-Series-Prediction
Implementation of different RNN architectures for Time Series Prediction for Currency Markets. 

In this project I experimented with different architectures of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Time Series Prediction. The data I used consist of Daily EURUSD prices. The architectures, I will be implementing and comparing are:
1.	LSTM with Residual Connections
2.	Attention Based LSTM
